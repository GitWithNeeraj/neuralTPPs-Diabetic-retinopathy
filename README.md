# neuralTPPs-Diabetic-retinopathy
This study explores the use of Neural Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) for predicting events related to Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a major vision impairment in diabetic patients. Using a large simulated Electronic Health Records (EHR) dataset, we compare Neural TPPs with other machine learning models in forecasting DR events and medication usage.
